This project implements a Parallel File Encrypter and Decrypter in Js, utilizing multithreading and multiprocessing to
accelerate the encryption and decryption of large files. The system is built on core Operating System concepts such as
process management, thread synchronization, and inter-process communication. It employs the byte-wise Caesar Cipher
for hashing and ensures secure, chunk-wise file processing. The parallel architecture significantly improves performance
while maintaining strong cryptographic integrity.
